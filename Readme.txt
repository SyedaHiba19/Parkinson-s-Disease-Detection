Aim: Developing a machine learning model based on human voice deflections to confirm Parkinson's disease symptoms. A large amount of data is collected in our model from both the normal person and the previously affected person with Parkinson's disease. Machine learning algorithms are used to train this data. The project achieved an efficiency rate of 88%.

Scope: The goal of this project is to demonstrate the high accuracy rate of detecting Parkinson's disease at an early stage.
